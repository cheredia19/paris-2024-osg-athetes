Then I met my husband in the Dominican Republic. At that moment I started riding, but just for fun. So we jumped into dressage, super disciplined and riding full-time on Spanish horses. We did jumps, we did everything. The reason I love dressage is because it's not your typical sport that when you reach the age of 30 you're done.
